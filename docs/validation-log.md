# Validation log

## 2026-08-23 - Inputs and environment

- The target directory existed and contained empty code directories plus the
  two reference files.
- All 6 PDF pages and all 8 PPTX slides were read and visually inspected.
- Fig. 3/Fig. 4 geometry and line ordering were checked.
- Slide 6 peak positions were read as 10.065, 9.685, 6.279, 2.445, 2.443 and
  2.003 nV s.
- Conda environment "hep" contains Geant4 11.2.2, CMake 3.30.2, CLHEP
  2.4.6.2, Qt 5.15.8 and real-surface data 2.2.
- Apple Clang 21.0.0 and Xcode command-line tools are available.

## 2026-08-23 - A0 optical smoke test

- CMake found Geant4 11.2.2 at
  "/opt/homebrew/Caskroom/miniconda/base/envs/hep/lib/cmake/Geant4".
- The project compiled and linked with conda Clang 16.0.6 and no compiler
  warnings.
- Geant4 reported "Checking overlaps for volume GAGG ... OK".
- The run header reported 550 nm = 2.25426 eV and an absorption length of
  64.5161 cm.
- Ten fixed-seed events ran. All ten photons had world_exit=1,
  bulk_absorption=0 and unclassified=0.
- CTest result: 1/1 passed.

Status: validation gate A0 passed. No Stage A reflector, LUT surface,
scintillation source or gamma source has been added.
